Does your game...
...do something technically interesting? Are you particularly proud of a programming technique you implemented? Did you look beyond the class examples and learn how to do something new? (5)
...have a great visual style? Does it use music or art that you're particularly proud of? Are you trying something new or clever with the endless runner form? (5)
